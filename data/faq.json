        "answer": "If you define the RSE as non-deterministic, you can rely on your own directory structure and just have to register the PFN where the file is located as well.\nIn case of a deterministic RSE, you would have to place the files based on the deterministic function being used (Most likely the hashing).\nIn that case you can do the registration as well, but Rucio would require that the file is based in a directory based on the has function.",
