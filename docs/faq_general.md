## How did this project came to be?
Different levels of expert support are available for users in case of problems. When satisfying answers are not found at lower support levels, a request from a user or a group of users can be escalated to the Rucio support. Due to the vast amount of support requests, methods to assist the support team in answering these requests are needed.

The aim of the project under GSoC 2020 is to use Native Language Processing (NLP) to develop an intelligent bot prototype able to provide satisfying answers to Rucio users and handle support requests up to a certain level of complexity, forwarding only the remaining ones to the experts.

Look at [FAQ : GSoC](./docs/../faq_gsoc.md) for more info.

## How is this used at Rucio?


Donkeybot is capable of and provides an end-to-end pipeline for Rucio related Question Answering. But, it is not currently deployed in any production server.

Rather, it is currently being tested for performance with sample examples and improved by the maintainers.

See Future Improvements under [FAQ : GSoC](faq_gsoc.md) for what we are working on.

## How can this be used at my Organization?

Donkeybot in it's current state is probably not very useful for your custom needs.  
The scope of this project under GSoC was not to make a general purpose Question Answering system, rather fit it for the needs of the Rucio users.

That said, Donkeybot can be expanded to handle more general data sources.
If you are interested in helping or want to look if that is something we are currently working on look at the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/rucio/donkeybot/issues) and/or contribute.
