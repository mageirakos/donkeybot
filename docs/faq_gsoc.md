## Who wrote Donkeybot during GSoC '20?

Hey thereüëã  
My name is Vasilis, from Greece and I'm a student developer !    
You probably guessed half of that if you know about GSoC and the other half by looking at my name.   

The important thing you need to know is that I loved this experience and working with everyone in the Rucio team, so if you're thinking about applying to [GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) or [contributing to Rucio](https://rucio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html), give it a shot !

If you have any questions regarding Donkeybot, Google Summer of Code or anything else just [contact me](https://github.com/mageirakos).     
I'm always happy to respond üòÅ

## What is GSoC?

- Links explanation
  
## Is there an official GSoC FAQ besides this... thing?

Of course! Don't just read my thoughts, visit the official Google Summer of Code [FAQ page](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq) and read more. 

Maybe I should just feed Donkeybot the GSoC documentation and see how that performs!    
Or you can [contribute](/docs/getting_started.md) and do it yourself üòÅ

## Where can I see a detailed timeline of the project?

Like every student I kept a daily/weekly [Progress Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZwDS5vze91rO0WSC9IQEmBAzL9gpJytaLW-eqj1kTpQ/edit?usp=sharing) to track everything I did throughout the project. It is not detailed to the point of mentioning specific methods/functions/lines of code implemented per day. But, you get a good idea at how and most importantly when I worked on everything. 

I went back while writing this document and added some 'notes from the future' for some things mentioned that you won't find in the source code.  

## What was the original proposal for the project?

Original Proposal
 [Original Proposal](https://github.com/TomasJavurek/hsf.github.io/blob/master/_gsocproposals/2020/proposal_RucioSupportBot.md) Which changed and was expanded upon etc

## What problems did you face?

- talk about emails in initial data analysis and how we tackled the problem and changed the scope a bit


## Do you suggest any future improvements?

- say how performance can be improved


## Can you provide a Reading List with material that helped you during GSoC?
